<p id="rules">The player will choose first if they would like to be evens or odds. The computer then has the other. The player 

and the computer will each choose either a 1 or a 0. The player wins if the sum of their returns is the same as what they chose. 

(EX: You choose odds. You throw a 1, the computer throws a 2. That's a sum of 3, which is odd, so you win!)</p>
